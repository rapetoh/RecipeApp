# Documentation Index

This directory contains documentation for major implementation steps and features.

## Documentation Standards

For every major step or feature implementation, create a documentation file that includes:

1. **Overview**: What was implemented and why
2. **Problem Statement**: What problem was being solved
3. **Solution**: How the problem was solved
4. **Architecture**: Technical details and flow diagrams
5. **Files Created/Modified**: List of all changes
6. **API Endpoints**: If applicable, document request/response formats
7. **Testing**: How to test the implementation
8. **Future Improvements**: Potential enhancements

## Available Documentation

## Adding New Documentation

When implementing a major feature or making significant changes:

1. Create a new markdown file in the root directory (or this docs folder for larger features)
2. Follow the template structure shown in existing docs
3. Include code examples, file paths, and clear explanations
4. Update this README with a link to the new documentation
5. Add the implementation date and status
